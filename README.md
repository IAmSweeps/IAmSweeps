I'm Kyle and I do Software QA. I have been performing Manual Testing for several years and dipping my toe in automation when I can. I love learning new languages, design patterns, and tools.

  My Development Path
 </summary>
 My development journey goes all the way back to when I was asked in 3rd grade, "What do you want to be when you grow up? I said, very confidently, "I want to make video games." As an 8-year-old in 1991, I didn't know that making video games hadn't become a thing that a lot of people did (I realize it still isn't, but at least the idea isn't so farfetched) and I was laughed at. I wasn't deterred by this. 
 
 Fast forward a bunch of years and I graduated high school, joined the Navy for almost 10 years, performed basic IT work, then was introduced to Software QA. At the time, I didn't know that was something people actually got paid to do. I had heard of video game beta testers, but that was it. My whole world got rocked and I felt like I had found my calling. Sure, it's not making video games, but I love it. My first several years were in Manual QA, but I was learning programming languages, automation testing design patterns, and familiarizing myself with various tools for automating tests at the same time.

 When I finally had a chance to write automated tests in a professional setting, I was hooked. This is what I am supposed to be doing, right now. Video games might still be in my future, but for now, I am happy to be ensuring that the quality of the software being released is the highest that I can help make it.
